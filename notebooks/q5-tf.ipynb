    "*We have gotten some questionable R^2 scores, ranging from the bad(5.7%, 11%) to the truly abysmal (-4.4 Bn, -700 Mn). Dropping numbers from the descriptions seems to have decreased the R^2 about 2 percentage points, but the numbers do not seem to be meaningful since permit `purpose` fields can contain phone numbers, square footage, time, etc. Matt P. sent over [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/tf-idf-for-document-ranking-from-scratch-in-python-on-real-world-dataset-796d339a4089) that might help us get better data, but for now, this R^2 of ~30% seems workable. Let's join these sparse matrices back to the rest of the dataset to incorporate permits into our price change predictions.*"
